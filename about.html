    <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            Outside of coursework and research, I have sought experiences that emphasize communication,
            responsibility, and hands-on problem solving.
        </p>

        <h2>Customer Service Experience</h2>

        <p>
            From May 2023 to May 2024, I worked as a customer service representative with University of Florida Housing.
            In this role, I regularly interacted with students, families, and staff, helping resolve housing-related
            concerns and providing front-line support in a high-traffic environment. The position strengthened my
            ability to communicate clearly, remain composed under pressure, and work effectively with people from
            diverse backgrounds.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was also featured on the UF Housing website during my time in the role.

        <h2>Automotive Shop Mechanic</h2>

        <p>
            During the summer of 2024, I worked at an automotive repair shop, where I gained practical,
            hands-on experience with mechanical systems and diagnostics.

        <h2>Road Travel</h2>

        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy road trips as a way to explore new places and challenge myself through
            long-distance travel. In Spring 2025, I drove from Gainesville to New York City, and in Summer 2025,
            I completed a cross-country drive from Gainesville to Seattle.

        <h2>Other Interests</h2>

        <p>
            I am also interested in photography and cooking. While these are personal hobbies rather than
            formal pursuits, they provide a creative outlet and a balance to my technical work.
